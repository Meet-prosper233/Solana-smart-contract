# Solana Smart Contract Project

## Overview

This project showcases a simple Solana smart contract written in Rust that implements a basic token system. Users can mint, transfer, and burn tokens securely on the Solana blockchain.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Solana** (Anchor Framework)
- **Rust**
- **JavaScript** (for scripts and tests)
- **Node.js**
